    <li> 
      This third largest estuary in the world was initially developed approximately 12,000 years ago when glaciers melted and FLOODED the 
      Susquehanna River valley. This fact justifies why the Susquehanna riverbasin is the largest portion or denomination of the Chesapeake Bay
    and is comprised of 3 states!

      Chesepeke Bay is 21 feet but the deepest part is 174 feet deep and is also known as "The Hole."The Bay also ranges from 3.4 miles wide to 
      35 miles wide and lastly the Bay hold up to 15 TRILLION GALLONS of water!
