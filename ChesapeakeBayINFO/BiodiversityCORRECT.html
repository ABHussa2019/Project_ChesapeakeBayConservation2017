   <li>
     (Top left) RIPARIAN FOREST: Are vital to health of Chesapeake Bay and its abundant rivers and streams because FIRSTLY, these 
     forests function as excellent buffers between upland waters and rivers that utlimately result into the bay. 
     Secondly, they are capable of filtering ground AND surface water, stablizing streambanks, and supporting an immesne variety of ecosystems.
     Forrested buffers are capable of retaining and absorbing ~85% of toxic substances such as PHOSPHORUS and NITROGEN. 
   </li>
   
   <br>
   
   <li>
    (Besides RF) FRESHWATER TRIBUTARIES: the 5 major rivers, as listed in the prvious page supply almsot 90% of all of the fresh water 
     evident  in the Bay!! These rivers are the origination of fresh water in the bay, which is crucial, in order for the fresh water 
     organisms to survive and prosper.
